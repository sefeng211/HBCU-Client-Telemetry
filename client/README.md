## Note Saver

This addon allows users to save notes to Firefox. There are two ways to
save notes.

  1. Users can save short text via the 'Quick Mode'
  2. Users can save long text via the 'Full Mode'

Questions that we'd like to answer
  1. Which method is more popular?
  2. How often do users use the addon?
  3. The responsiveness of the saving operation
